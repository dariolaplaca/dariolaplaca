## Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🎉

👋 **Hello there!** I'm Dario, a passionate and dedicated developer with a focus on back-end development using **Java, Spring, and object-oriented programming (OOP)**. I am excited to share my projects, code samples, and learning journey with you through this GitHub profile.

## About Me

🚀 I have always had a strong affinity and interest for **problem-solving and logical thinking**, which led me to pursue a career in software development. My journey began with Java, where I gained a solid understanding of the language and its object-oriented principles. As I delved deeper into back-end development, I discovered the power of the Spring framework and its ability to simplify and streamline the development process.

## What You'll Find Here

📂 In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects and code samples that showcase my skills in back-end development, specifically using Java and Spring. **These projects reflect my learning journey**, from my early days as a beginner to my current status as a developer with decent knowledge and experience.

## My Interests

🌟 While I primarily **focus on back-end development**, I am also interested in expanding my horizons and exploring other realms of software development. At the moment I am **discovering the front-end world** cause I am willing to expand my knowledge and skill set. I believe that having a well-rounded understanding of both the back-end and front-end aspects of development is crucial in creating robust and user-friendly applications. I have **a keen interest in learning software and game development** as well, and I am eager to embark on new and exciting coding adventures in these areas.

🎮 I am a **video gamer** and enjoy both cooperative and competitive gaming experiences. There's something exhilarating about collaborating with others to achieve a common goal or testing my skills against formidable opponents.

🍳 **Cooking** is another passion of mine. Exploring different cuisines, experimenting with ingredients, and creating delicious dishes from scratch bring me immense joy and satisfaction. Who knows, you might find some coding-inspired recipes in this repository!

✏️ **Drawing** is yet another outlet for my creative expression. Whether it's doodling in my sketchbook or creating digital illustrations, I find solace and inspiration in the world of art, I am not really good but I enjoy spending my time doing it to ease my mind.
